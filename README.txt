README

This repository contains all of the code and data for my final project of Government 1005, which explores the consequences of inequality.

Due to the changing nature of this project, this repository is more scrambled than I would have preferred. The Final Project folder contains
the R Markdown files where I originally drafted the R code which was utilized in the shiny app. After I created my plots and models, I 
then copied the relevant code to the shiny app. The original coding can be seen in inequality_vs_populism.Rmd, inequality_vs_populism_2.Rmd,
and social_spending_vs_inequality.Rmd. As a result, all of the data I used in my project is also located in this folder. 

There is a folder called Datasets, where I would originally import all of the data for exploring, before I decided whether or not to use
the data in my project. Much of my original, uncleaned data is located there. Then, in the Data folder, there are two folders and an unused
app.R R file, which the user can ignore.

In the App-1 folder, there is all the data I utilized in my final project, along with app2.R R file which is the shiny file for my shiny website.
Additionally, there is a www file with all of the images utilized in my shiny webpage.
